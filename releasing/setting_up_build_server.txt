Install perl

install package:
sudo cpan Net::SSH::Perl
 - if building failes with "Could not make: unknown error" make might be missing, install with 'sudo apt-get install build-essential'

verify ssh-agent is running 'eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"'

add keyfiles with 'ssh-add ~/.ssh/hostmonster_rsa' and 'ssh-add ~/.ssh/bitbucket_rsa'
