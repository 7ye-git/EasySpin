Installing perl

	- sudo apt-get install perl

	- install package:
		- sudo cpan Net::SSH::Perl
		- if building failes with "Could not make: unknown error" make might be missing, install with 'sudo apt-get install build-essential'
		- if it still does not install: 'sudo cpan' 'install -f Net::SSH::Perl' - this forces the install even if dependencies are missing or not passing all tests
 
 
Setting up SSH authentication
	- sudo apt-get install ssh 
	- copy key files hostmonster_rsa and bitbucket_rsa (need to create one for user) to: ~/.ssh/
	- set the ssh agent up to run automatically when somebody logs in:
		- add the following to ~/.bash_profile, if .bash_profile does not exist, just create a new one
			SSH_ENV="$HOME/.ssh/environment"

			function start_agent {
				echo "Initialising new SSH agent..."
				/usr/bin/ssh-agent | sed 's/^echo/#echo/' > "${SSH_ENV}"
				echo succeeded
				chmod 600 "${SSH_ENV}"
				. "${SSH_ENV}" > /dev/null
				/usr/bin/ssh-add;
			}

			# Source SSH settings, if applicable

			if [ -f "${SSH_ENV}" ]; then
				. "${SSH_ENV}" > /dev/null
				ps -ef | grep ${SSH_AGENT_PID} | grep ssh-agent$ > /dev/null || {
				start_agent;
			}
			else
				start_agent;
			fi
		- now every time you login you should get a message that the SSH agent is being initialised
	- add keyfiles with 'ssh-add ~/.ssh/hostmonster_rsa' and 'ssh-add ~/.ssh/bitbucket_rsa' (this also needs to be done from within the build script and hence the pathes need to be updated, see below)
	- it might be necessary to change read write permissions:
		- chmod 600 ~/.ssh/KEYFILES
		
	
Install TexLive
	- sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-extra
	- make sure the dvisvgm package is installed:
		- sudo apt install texlive-extra-utils
		- verify with: dvisvgm -V


Install and verify MATLAB installation


Install and setup up mercurial
	- sudo apt-get install mercurial
	- setup the easyspin directories:
		- mkdir ~/easyspin-buildsys
		- cd ~/easyspin-buildsys
		- mkdir ./easyspin ./easyspin-builds ./uploads
	- clone easyspin
		- cd easyspin
		- hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/sstoll/easyspin
		- if the keys were set up correctly that should trigger the download
	- make sure the purge extension is available
		- nano ./.hg/hgrc
		- add the following two lines to the the bottom of the file (it is okay that the purge = has nothing to the right of the equal sign)
			[extensions]
			purge = 
	

Setup the buildsys
	- in the easyspin directory:
		- hg pull -u
		- hg update default
	- copy the buildsys files
		- cp ./releasing/* ~/easyspin-buildsys
	- verify all the paths and options are correct
		- cd ~/easyspin-buildsys
		- nano build.pl
		- verify all entries in the Settings section
		

Running the buildsys
	- two ways are available to run the buildsys
	- build all EasySpin versions that are not in the easyspin-builds directory and upload the most recent versions
		- perl build.pl
	- build a specific tag
		- perl build.pl 5.3.1
		- only builds the easyspin version, but does not upload anything
